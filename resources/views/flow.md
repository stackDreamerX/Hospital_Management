Hospital Bed Management System Logic
Focus solely on managing hospital beds (WardBed), without expanding into room management. Below is the detailed database design, workflow, and actor roles.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Design (Optimized from the current ERD)
‚ö° Key Tables:
WardBed

WardBedID (Primary Key)

WardID (Foreign Key - optional if linking to ward areas)

BedNumber (Bed identifier)

Status (ENUM: available, occupied, maintenance)

PatientWardAllocation

AllocationID (Primary Key)

PatientID (Foreign Key)

WardBedID (Foreign Key)

AllocationDate (Date assigned)

DischargeDate (Date released)

üí° Optional Table:
WardBedHistory (Track bed usage history)

HistoryID

WardBedID

PatientID

FromDate

ToDate

Note

2Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow
üéØ Objectives:
Manage bed status in real-time.

Track bed assignments and discharges.

Ensure optimal utilization of available beds.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Actor Roles & Responsibilities
üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor:
Assign beds to patients when hospitalization is required.

During consultation, if hospitalization is needed, the doctor requests a bed.

The system checks for available beds.

Doctor either selects a bed or sends a request to Admin.

Monitor patients' bed assignments.

View a list of admitted patients and their assigned beds.

üë®‚Äçüíº Admin:
Manage Bed Inventory (WardBed):

Add / Edit / Remove beds.

Update bed status:

available: Ready for use.

occupied: Currently assigned to a patient.

maintenance: Under cleaning or repair.

Allocate Beds:

Process doctor‚Äôs requests or manually assign beds.

Record allocation in PatientWardAllocation.

Update bed Status to occupied.

Discharge Beds:

Upon patient discharge:

Update DischargeDate.

Change bed status back to available or maintenance if cleaning is needed.

Reporting:

Monitor:

Number of available, occupied, and maintenance beds.

Bed usage history.

üßë‚Äçü¶Ω Patient:
No direct interaction with the bed management system.

Can view assigned bed information, such as:

"You are assigned to Bed No. 12".

Estimated discharge date (if provided by Doctor/Admin).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Process Flow
‚û§ Step 1: Check Available Beds
Admin or Doctor reviews the list of beds where Status = available.

‚û§ Step 2: Assign Bed

Create a record in PatientWardAllocation:

PatientID, WardBedID, AllocationDate = NOW().

Update WardBed:

Set Status = occupied.

‚û§ Step 3: Discharge Process

When patient is discharged:

Update DischargeDate in PatientWardAllocation.

Change WardBed.Status to available or maintenance.

‚û§ Step 4: Bed Maintenance

Admin sets bed status to maintenance for cleaning or repairs.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Example Scenario
Doctor examines Patient A ‚ûú Hospitalization required.

Doctor checks available beds or sends a request.

Admin assigns Bed No. 12 to Patient A.

System:

Records the allocation.

Updates WardBedID 12 status to occupied.

Upon discharge:

Admin updates discharge date.

Bed 12 status changes to maintenance.

After cleaning, Admin sets status back to available.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Suggested UI/UX Design
Admin Dashboard:
Bed list with status filters.

"Allocate Bed" button.

Quick reports:

Total beds.

Occupied beds.

Available beds.

Beds under maintenance.

Doctor View:
List of admitted patients.

Display patient names and assigned bed numbers.

Patient View:
Notification:
"You are assigned to Bed No. 12".
